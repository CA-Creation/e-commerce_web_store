# E-Commerce App with React, TypeScript, and Vite

## Demo

## Overview

This project is a fully functional e-commerce application designed to provide users with a seamless shopping experience. Built using modern web development tools and frameworks, the app leverages **React** for its component-based architecture, **TypeScript** for type safety, and **Vite** for a fast and efficient development environment. The application is styled using **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a clean, responsive, and visually appealing design that adapts to all screen sizes.

The app is structured to handle various e-commerce functionalities, including product browsing, filtering. Users can add products to their shopping cart, manage quantities, and select sizes before proceeding to checkout. Additionally, a wishlist feature allows users to save their favorite items for future reference.

One of the key goals of this project is to demonstrate best practices in modern web development. The modular structure ensures scalability, making it easy to add new features or modify existing ones. The use of TypeScript ensures robust type-checking, reducing runtime errors and improving code quality. Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach to styling, enabling rapid development without sacrificing customization.

The application is designed to be lightweight and performant, thanks to Vite's optimized build process and hot module replacement (HMR). This makes it ideal for both small-scale projects and larger applications that require scalability. Whether you're a developer looking to learn modern web development techniques or a business owner seeking a customizable e-commerce solution, this project serves as a solid foundation.

The app also emphasizes accessibility and user experience, with features like responsive design, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support. Future updates will focus on expanding functionality, such as integrating payment gateways, adding user authentication, and implementing an admin panel for managing products and orders.
